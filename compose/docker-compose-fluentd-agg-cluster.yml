# Deploying a Fluentd cluster using this file assumes that overlay network 'voltha_net'
# has already been created. To deploy the fluentd cluster, issue the command:
#
#     docker stack deploy -c docker-compose-fluentd-cluster.yml fluentd
#
# This spins up two Fluentd Forwarders and one each Fluentd Aggregator-Active, Fluentd Aggregator-Standby.
# The forwards listens for voltha components logs on port 23224 and sends them towards Fluentd Aggregator. 
# Fluentd Aggregator writes them to their host mounted disk
