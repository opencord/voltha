# This stackfile deploys a Consul cluster to a docker swarm.
#
# The Consul cluster depends on:
# - voltha_net (overlay network)
#
# To deploy the cluster, issue the command:
#
#     docker stack deploy -c docker-compose-consul-cluster.yml consul
#
# This command will create overlay network 'consul_net'.
